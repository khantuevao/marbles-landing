      <div>Overview</div>
      <p>Marbleverse is a high-risk, high-reward game of equal opportunity that offers players a chance to 2x-100x their investment in a matter of hours. Simple, fast, and transparent, it crowdsources funds and distributes them in a gamified way.</p>
      <p>So, how does it work? Similar to poker or chess competitions, a PvP tournament is organized and a handsome prize fund generated from buy-ins. A series of elimination rounds is then held to determine the winner. Top 10-15% of players are rewarded with prizes ranging from 200% up to 10,000% of their initial capital. With a theoretical prize pool capped only by the number of participants, the winner of a massive tournament can become a millionaire in mere hours</p>
      <p>Our recipe for success: Games of equal chance + Crypto = Enormous untapped potential. Marbleverse's mission is to unlock this opportunity for everyone. To bootstrap the project, we are looking to build a community of enthusiasts that share our vision. All contributors of 0.04 ETH+ will receive a unique founding member Marbleverse NFT with extensive utility.</p>
